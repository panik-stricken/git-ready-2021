# GitHub Markdown
### [Back to Index](../README.md)

Markdown is a way to add features to a page without using the full HTML markup language. 
As it turns out, HTML works for many things, if not all. But why not. 

_Whats a Gist?_ __Apparently__ it's like a code snippet. 

From the help documents, [Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github)

Text, can be italicized, bold, or constructed as links with the square brackets holding the label, and the link in following parens. Also, with links, if you prepend your label bracket with a !, you create an image link.

Lists are either bulleted with the dash or asterix, or numbered, with numbers.

 1. One
 2. A  
   ii well...  
   iii With some finagling
 3. Another

Headers begin with the pound sign, one pound for each h level desired.
## this is a 2
### this is a 3

single backticks create `inline code` and the code fencing _using triple backticks_ works well for blocks of code. highlighting can be activated by adding a language after the opening fence.

I Like Tasklists!  
 - [ ] But they dont like to work in my editor...
 - [x] So I tend not to use them. Maybe a plugin?

Tables are supposed to be handy:

Header | DataPoint | Further Thingy  
-------|-----------|---------------  
And now|For something|Completely different
But do they | Do what they | are supposed to do

There are also the SHA references, user @mentions, and issue linkage. 

Oh, and Emojis. :smile: Again, they don't like to work on my editor.
