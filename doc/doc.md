# GitHub Documentation
### [Back to Index](../README.md)

Common Formatting includes:
 - A Project Name
 - A clear description
 - The Table of Contents
 - Installation Instructions
 - Usage. _Screenshots are usually included_
 - Contribution Guidelines
 - Credits and Attributions
 - License

You can also use the wiki system built into the GitHub product

One of the spefically mentioned features of the Wiki pages is Language Highlighting. I believe this is covered in the Markdown docs.

``` javascript
 const app = new Vue({
     el: '#app',
     data: {}
 })
```
