# GitHub Flow
### [Back to Index](../README.md)

Github is designed to be used in a team of developers, to track what is going on, in a lightweight manner, and geared for regular deployments. I.E. this is too much documentation framework for the projects I plan to develop at this time. No worries though. Understanding the workflow should, theoretically, at least keep my skillset within acceptable for hiring purposes.

Branching is the KEY concept behind the working of Git and GitHub. Main is to be ready, ready and viewable, ready, viewable, and running, rea... come in again.
  > The plan then, it to make changes on branches, and only merge the branches when the code works per branch. This creates a wealth of confusion for me. I guess, the best way to get over that is to dive in until it makes sense.

Commits are added, hopefully in small bitesized chunks, to help track changes both proposed, added, and in an effort to assist with rollbacks, whould errors become unweildly.

Pull requests are used for many things.
  - Screenshots
  - Ideas
  - Solicit Advice
  - Request Reviews

Basically, if you would like to start a conversation or if you are pretty sure you are done with the work, create a pull request to begin the process of merging your 
contributions into the final, ready viewable running project. 

Once the pull request has been opened, things might still require some tweaking. 
 - Stylistic choices
 - Unit Tests __And these will likely need to be included on every team project to save a lot of manual digging for quality purposes__
 - Or, and it happens, you might have everything just so and ready to go.

Deployment may be direct from branch, temp merge to master merge, or merged directly, depending on your teams workflow specifics.

And that concludes the Workflow portion of our first guide. Not too shabby there coder!

Introduction to new topics that need explored:
  - Markdown: Used in pull requests and conversations, useful for many styling choices during the discussion process.
  - Issues: Another good way to track things that need attention. adds a layer of complexity, but not a too difficult one if I remember.
  - Merge Conflicts and Resolution
  - Continuous Integration
