# GitHub Issues
### [Back to Index](../README.md)

Issues have:
  - A title
  - A description
And can include:
  - Labels _for categorization and filtering_
  - A single assignee _to track responsability and avoid too many cooks at the pot_
  - Comments _A full discussion forum_
And even further, can be grouped into:
  - Milestones _it looks like projects are also an option now_

A __Milestone__ is a collection of issues that go along with a project, feature, or time period. Use these to keep yourself focused.

_Notifications, mentions, and References_ are avilible in the comments section via the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github#name-and-team-mentions-autocomplete), this topic is to be covered in the [Mastering Markdown](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) portion later as well.

Basically though:
 - you can <code>@mention</code> users, like myself @panik-stricken. This allows users to recieve notifications when your codebase changes, making the communication a bit easier.
 - you can reference items, like our first issue #2, each primary action it seems is numbered as a whole. Try not to worry too much about that.
   > By adding a list of issues in your commentary, it appears you can get notifications about all of them at once? This will be a fun and pwerful feature if ever I learn to unlock it.
- There is a <code>/cc</code> option as well. 

These are the bits that seem to resonate as useful with me at the moment. Edits could happen. But this seems like enough to keep us busy for now.

New features to look into:
  - Milestones
  - Projects
