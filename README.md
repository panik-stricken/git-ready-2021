Another year, another Doug

Firstly, this seasons workflow will require:
  > A single repository per project. If I don't like that, try sticking to a fewer number of sharded ideas.
  > Begin on github, end on github. Cloud storage is GOING to be a thing this year.

Github is designed to be used in a team of developers, to track what is going on, in a lightweight manner, and geared for regular deployments. I.E. this is too much documentation framework for the projects I plan to develop at this time. No worries though. Understanding the workflow should, theoretically, at least keep my skillset within acceptable for hiring purposes.

Branching is the KEY concept behind the working of Git and GitHub. Main is to be ready, ready and viewable, ready, viewable, and running, rea... come in again.
  > The plan then, it to make changes on branches, and only merge the branches when the code works per branch. This creates a wealth of confusion for me. I guess, the best way to get over that is to dive in until it makes sense.
