# git-ready-2021
 > Another year, another Doug

Firstly, this seasons workflow will require:
  - A single repository per project. If I don't like that, try sticking to a fewer number of sharded ideas.
  - Begin on github, end on github. Cloud storage is GOING to be a thing this year.

Alright. Let's start with the source [GitHub Guides: Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and the [Results](./doc/flow.md)

 > NOTE: when creating a new branch, use <code>git push --set-upstream origin <var>branchName</var></code> to create the branch on github.

 And so, we have already used an issue in the development of this project, so let's now look at the source [GitHub Guides: Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), and the [Results](./doc/issues.md)

 Documentation is the key to many things. So here we look at the source [GitHub Guides: Documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/) and the [Result](./doc/doc.md)
